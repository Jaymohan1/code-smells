An airline has following rules for calculating bonus amount for loyalty points for a customer based on which tier they are in:

* If a customer is in Platinum tier, add 50% more points above regular points.
* If a customer is in Gold tier, add 30% more points above regular points.
* If a customer is in Silver tier, add 15% more points above regular points.
* If a customer is in Blue tier, then there are no bonus points, just regular points.
* Spending INR 100 earns a regular point.
